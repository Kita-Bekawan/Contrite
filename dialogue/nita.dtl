nita (default): Hi there, how are you today?
arhan: I'm okay, I guess. But I miss home.
nita: I understand, sweetheart.
nita: How about we sit down for a moment?
nita: You can tell me how you're feeling.
arhan: My parents... They... They're gone, Ma'am.
arhan: I don't know where they went.
arhan: Everyone says they... they're not here anymore...
nita: I know it's tough, dear.
nita: But trust me, here you'll meet new friends and receive love.
arhan: But it's not the same. I want my mom and dad.
