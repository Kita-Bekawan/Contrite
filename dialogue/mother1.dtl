mother: Hey there!
mother:  You must be new around here.
mother: I'm Laras. What's your name?
arhan: I... I'm... I'm not sure.
arhan: Everything's so... so strange.
mother: Are you okay? You look a bit lost.
arhan: I... I think so. I just... I don't know how I got here.
mother: Well, you're not alone.
mother: I've been here for a while now,
mother: but I still don't understand much about this place.
mother: It's beautiful, though, isn't it?
arhan: Yeah, it is. But it's also... overwhelming.
arhan: I need to find a way out of this place.
arhan: I need to go back home.
mother: I see. It's natural to long for what you know.
mother: But leaving the tree world is not a simple task.
mother: It will require great effort and determination.
arhan: I'll do whatever it takes.
mother: Very well. If you're set on leaving, I'll do my best to assist you.
mother: Go ahead and take this path.
mother: I'll catch up with you at the next location.
